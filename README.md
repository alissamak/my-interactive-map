# Mapping Project

This is the final activity for Lesson 12 to Build an Interactive Map by user location.

Interactive Map should have functions to:
    1. Get user location
    2. Pin point coords of location
    3. Use user's coords to display map from Leaflet
    4. Create 4 layers on map: coffee, restaurant, hotel, and market
    5. Use Foursquare API to pull the pins of each layer
    6. Display four views in dropdown menu
    7. Display button to select the dropdown menu selection

Optional/Bonus:
    1.Improve Css styling
    2. Add a custom marker for the user's location.
    3.Think about possible event listeners for getting the business type from the user. Improve the accessibility in getting the value.
    4. Add additional information to the business pop-ups.
    5. Add different style markers for different business types.
    6. Add the ability to clear the markers (aside from user location).
    7. Add the ability to remove one business type of marker when another is selected through Leaflet controls.
    8. Use local storage and object oriented JavaScript to enable the application to view multiple maps for multiple locations.
    9. Allow the user to manually enter a location to create a map.
    10. Consider how you could make the application available offline?
